# Filter

## API Description
Returns a filter.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None, however, the filter is only returned where it is:

 *  owned by the user.
 *  shared with a group that the user is a member of.
 *  shared with a private project that the user has *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for.

## Purpose
Extract specific data from Jira for project analysis and reporting

## When to Use
When you need this specific data point for project analysis or reporting requirements

## Key Data Points
• **id**: The ID of the filter to return.
• **expand**: Use [expand](#expansion) to include additional information about filter in the response. This parameter accepts a comma-separated list. Expand options include:

 *  `sharedUsers` Returns the users that the filter is shared with. This includes users that can browse projects that the filter is shared with. If you don't specify `sharedUsers`, then the `sharedUsers` object is returned but it doesn't list any users. The list of users returned is limited to 1000, to access additional users append `[start-index:end-index]` to the expand request. For example, to access the next 1000 users, use `?expand=sharedUsers[1001:2000]`.
 *  `subscriptions` Returns the users that are subscribed to the filter. If you don't specify `subscriptions`, the `subscriptions` object is returned but it doesn't list any subscriptions. The list of subscriptions returned is limited to 1000, to access additional subscriptions append `[start-index:end-index]` to the expand request. For example, to access the next 1000 subscriptions, use `?expand=subscriptions[1001:2000]`.
• **overrideSharePermissions**: EXPERIMENTAL: Whether share permissions are overridden to enable filters with any share permissions to be returned. Available to users with *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

## Project Analysis Value
