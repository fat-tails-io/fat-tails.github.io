  ##### Validate a field value #####
  
  A validation that ensures a specific field's value meets the defined criteria before allowing an issue to transition in the workflow.
  
  Depending on the rule type, the result will vary:
  
  ###### Field required ######
  
      {
         "ruleKey": "system:validate-field-value",

   *  `fieldsRequired` the ID of the field that is required. For a custom field, it would look like `customfield_123`.
   *  `ignoreContext` controls the impact of context settings on field validation. When set to `true`, the validator doesn't check a required field if its context isn't configured for the current issue. When set to `false`, the validator requires a field even if its context is invalid. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.
   *  `errorMessage` is the error message to display if the user does not provide a value during the transition. A default error message will be shown if you don't provide one (Optional).

    {
       "ruleKey": "system:previous-status-validator",
       "parameters": {
         "previousStatusIds": "10014",
         "mostRecentStatusOnly": "true"
       }
     }

Parameters:

##### Validate a field value #####

A validation that ensures a specific field's value meets the defined criteria before allowing an issue to transition in the workflow.

Depending on the rule type, the result will vary:

###### Field required ######

    {
       "ruleKey": "system:validate-field-value",
       "parameters": {
         "ruleType": "fieldRequired",

         "errorMessage": "An assignee must be set!"
       }
     }

Parameters:

 *  `fieldsRequired` the ID of the field that is required. For a custom field, it would look like `customfield_123`.
 *  `ignoreContext` controls the impact of context settings on field validation. When set to `true`, the validator doesn't check a required field if its context isn't configured for the current issue. When set to `false`, the validator requires a field even if its context is invalid. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.
 *  `errorMessage` is the error message to display if the user does not provide a value during the transition. A default error message will be shown if you don't provide one (Optional).

###### Field changed ######

       }
     }

Parameters:

 *  `groupsExemptFromValidation` a comma-separated list of group IDs to be exempt from the validation.
 *  `fieldKey` the ID of the field that has changed. For a custom field, it would look like `customfield_123`.
