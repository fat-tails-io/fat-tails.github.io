title: Find Users Assignable To Projects
description: |-
  Returns a list of users who can be assigned issues in one or more projects. The list may be restricted to users whose attributes match a string.
  
  This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that can be assigned issues in the projects. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who can be assigned issues in the projects, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.
  
  Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details.
  
  This operation can be accessed anonymously.

# Find Users Assignable To Projects

## API Description
Returns a list of users who can be assigned issues in one or more projects. The list may be restricted to users whose attributes match a string.

This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that can be assigned issues in the projects. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who can be assigned issues in the projects, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.

Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse Projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for each project specified in `projectKeys`.

## Purpose
Understand team composition, roles, and user activity patterns

## When to Use
When analyzing team performance, resource allocation, or conducting organizational analysis of project contributions

## Key Data Points
• **query**: A query string that is matched against user attributes, such as `displayName` and `emailAddress`, to find relevant users. The string can match the prefix of the attribute's value. For example, *query=john* matches a user with a `displayName` of *John Smith* and a user with an `emailAddress` of *johnson@example.com*. Required, unless `accountId` is specified.
• **username**: This parameter is no longer available. See the [deprecation notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/) for details.
• **accountId**: A query string that is matched exactly against user `accountId`. Required, unless `query` is specified.

## Project Analysis Value
Enables analysis of human resource utilization, identifies key contributors, and supports capacity planning and team optimization decisions

## Usage Examples
• Team performance and contribution analysis
• Resource capacity planning
• User activity and engagement metrics
• Role-based access and permission auditing

## Implementation
To use this data in Excel Power Query:

1. **Load the M code**: Use the function `JiraGetUserAssignableMultiprojectsearch` from [jira-userassignablemultiprojectsearch.m](../assets/jira-userassignablemultiprojectsearch.m)
2. **Configure authentication**: Ensure your Parameters table includes Jira credentials
3. **Execute the query**: The function will return structured data ready for analysis

### Function Parameters
• **query** (Optional): A query string that is matched against user attributes, such as `displayName` and `emailAddress`, to find relevant users. The string can match the prefix of the attribute's value. For example, *query=john* matches a user with a `displayName` of *John Smith* and a user with an `emailAddress` of *johnson@example.com*. Required, unless `accountId` is specified.
• **username** (Optional): This parameter is no longer available. See the [deprecation notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/) for details.
• **accountId** (Optional): A query string that is matched exactly against user `accountId`. Required, unless `query` is specified.
• **projectKeys** (Required): A list of project keys (case sensitive). This parameter accepts a comma-separated list.
• **startAt** (Optional): The index of the first item to return in a page of results (page offset).

### Expected Output
Structured table with expanded JSON data ready for Excel analysis
