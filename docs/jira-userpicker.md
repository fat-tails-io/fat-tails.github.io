  Returns a list of users whose attributes match the query term. The returned object includes the `html` field where the matched query term is highlighted with the HTML strong tag. A list of account IDs can be provided to exclude users from the results.
  
  This operation takes the users in the range defined by `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that match the query term.

# Find Users For Picker

## API Description
Returns a list of users whose attributes match the query term. The returned object includes the `html` field where the matched query term is highlighted with the HTML strong tag. A list of account IDs can be provided to exclude users from the results.

This operation takes the users in the range defined by `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that match the query term. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the query term, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.

Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg). Anonymous calls and calls by users without the required permission return search results for an exact name match only.

## Purpose
Understand team composition, roles, and user activity patterns

## When to Use
When analyzing team performance, resource allocation, or conducting organizational analysis of project contributions

## Key Data Points
• **query**: A query string that is matched against user attributes, such as `displayName`, and `emailAddress`, to find relevant users. The string can match the prefix of the attribute's value. For example, *query=john* matches a user with a `displayName` of *John Smith* and a user with an `emailAddress` of *johnson@example.com*.
• **maxResults**: The maximum number of items to return. The total number of matched users is returned in `total`.
• **showAvatar**: Include the URI to the user's avatar.

## Project Analysis Value
Enables analysis of human resource utilization, identifies key contributors, and supports capacity planning and team optimization decisions

## Usage Examples
• Team performance and contribution analysis
• Resource capacity planning
• User activity and engagement metrics
• Role-based access and permission auditing

## Implementation
To use this data in Excel Power Query:

1. **Load the M code**: Use the function `JiraGetUserPicker` from [jira-userpicker.m](../assets/jira-userpicker.m)
2. **Configure authentication**: Ensure your Parameters table includes Jira credentials
3. **Execute the query**: The function will return structured data ready for analysis

### Function Parameters
