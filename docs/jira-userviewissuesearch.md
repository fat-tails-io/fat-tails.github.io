title: Find Users With Browse Permission
description: |-
  Returns a list of users who fulfill these criteria:
  
   *  their user attributes match a search string.
   *  they have permission to browse issues.
  
  Use this resource to find users who can browse:
  
   *  an issue, by providing the `issueKey`.
   *  any issue in a project, by providing the `projectKey`.
  
  This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that match the search string and have permission to browse issues. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the search string and have permission to browse issues, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.
  
  Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details.
  
  This operation can be accessed anonymously.
  
  **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg). Anonymous calls and calls by users without the required permission return empty search results.

# Find Users With Browse Permission

## API Description
Returns a list of users who fulfill these criteria:

 *  their user attributes match a search string.
 *  they have permission to browse issues.

Use this resource to find users who can browse:

 *  an issue, by providing the `issueKey`.
 *  any issue in a project, by providing the `projectKey`.

This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that match the search string and have permission to browse issues. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the search string and have permission to browse issues, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.

Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details.

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg). Anonymous calls and calls by users without the required permission return empty search results.

## Purpose
Execute complex queries to extract specific data sets for targeted analysis

## When to Use
When you need to perform advanced filtering and data extraction for specialized reports or custom analysis scenarios

## Key Data Points
• **query**: A query string that is matched against user attributes, such as `displayName` and `emailAddress`, to find relevant users. The string can match the prefix of the attribute's value. For example, *query=john* matches a user with a `displayName` of *John Smith* and a user with an `emailAddress` of *johnson@example.com*. Required, unless `accountId` is specified.
• **username**: This parameter is no longer available. See the [deprecation notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/) for details.
• **accountId**: A query string that is matched exactly against user `accountId`. Required, unless `query` is specified.

## Project Analysis Value
Provides flexible data extraction capabilities for custom analysis scenarios, enabling sophisticated filtering and reporting beyond standard metrics

## Usage Examples
• Custom filtered reports for stakeholders
• Advanced trend analysis with specific criteria
• Compliance reporting with complex filters
• Ad-hoc analysis for specific business questions

## Implementation
To use this data in Excel Power Query:

1. **Load the M code**: Use the function `JiraGetUserViewissueSearch` from [jira-userviewissuesearch.m](../assets/jira-userviewissuesearch.m)
2. **Configure authentication**: Ensure your Parameters table includes Jira credentials
3. **Execute the query**: The function will return structured data ready for analysis

### Function Parameters
• **query** (Optional): A query string that is matched against user attributes, such as `displayName` and `emailAddress`, to find relevant users. The string can match the prefix of the attribute's value. For example, *query=john* matches a user with a `displayName` of *John Smith* and a user with an `emailAddress` of *johnson@example.com*. Required, unless `accountId` is specified.
• **username** (Optional): This parameter is no longer available. See the [deprecation notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/) for details.
• **accountId** (Optional): A query string that is matched exactly against user `accountId`. Required, unless `query` is specified.
• **issueKey** (Optional): The issue key for the issue. Required, unless `projectKey` is specified.
• **projectKey** (Optional): The project key for the project (case sensitive). Required, unless `issueKey` is specified.
• **startAt** (Optional): The index of the first item to return in a page of results (page offset).
• **maxResults** (Optional): The maximum number of items to return per page.

### Expected Output
Structured table with expanded JSON data ready for Excel analysis
