fat-tails - forensic understanding of root causes in project failure lead to improved overall success rates.

## What?
This is a collection of practical examples about business value, with the Atlassian API.

You will not see lengthy blogs posts, you will see practical tips with working code to implement value measurement and monitoring.

## Why?
Atlassian's "tent pole" software tools JIRA, JIRA Service Management (henceforth JSM), and Confluence are intuitive, easy-to-use and only getting more comprehensive.

As you become more sophisticated in their use, can you continue to track these 3 questions:

* are my projects driving value?
* can I attribute value to specific actions or contributions in my company's project management practice?  
* is it time I got even more value from my Atlassian tools?

## How?
As comprehensive as Atlassian tools are, some of our colleagues operate outside the eco-system. Here we help your finance team by meeting them in the tools they use.

Extracting value from the API strengthens your own confidence in the decision to use Atlassian, especially when it comes time for that all important upgrade decision.

## Where to start?
This collection assumes you know what an API is, but you believe it's helpful to know much more.

This collection also assumes you have an understanding of the Atlassian offering to help you with your productivity. If you need further assistance with all things Atlassian, please reach out [here](https://www.fat-tails.io/contact/).
