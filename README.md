fat-tails - forensic understanding of root causes in project failure lead to improved overall success rates.

## What?
This is a collection of practical examples about business value, with the Atlassian APIs.

You will not see lengthy blogs posts, only practical tips with working code to deliver value measurement and monitoring.

## Why?
Atlassian's "tent pole" software JIRA, JIRA Service Management (henceforth JSM), and Confluence are intuitive, easy-to-use and getting more comprehensive.

As you get more sophisticated with the APIs, can you continue to track these 3 questions:

* are my projects driving value?
* can I attribute value to specific actions or contributions in my company's project management practice?  
* is it time I got even more value from my Atlassian tools?

## How?
As comprehensive as Atlassian tools are, some of our colleagues operate outside the eco-system. Help your finance team(s) by meeting them in the tools they use.

Extracting value from the APIs strengthens your confidence in Atlassian tools, especially when it's time for important upgrade decision as your business grows.

## Where to start?
This collection assumes you know what an API is, but you believe it's helpful to know much more.

This collection also assumes you have an understanding of the Atlassian offering to help you with your productivity. If you need further assistance with all things Atlassian, please reach out [here](https://www.fat-tails.io/contact/).
